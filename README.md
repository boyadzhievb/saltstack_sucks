SALTSTACK SUCKS.

Everybody knows that so called Saltstack sucks, it is just 'coding in jinja' which force you to create
unmaintainble, spaghetti code.

I like that it was brought by so big company that doesn't have history to share innovation.
So with pleasure I can say that saltstack is officially dead! 
Thank God!
